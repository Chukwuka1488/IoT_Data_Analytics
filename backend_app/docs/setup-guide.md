#### Installation
To install and run the Express server, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from https://nodejs.org.

2. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/express-server.git
```
3. Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd express-server
```

4. Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install
```

#### Getting Started
To start the Express server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server on the default port (3500) unless the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to "test", in which case it will use port 4000.

#### Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the following endpoint:

* `GET /`: Returns a "Hello, World!" message.
You can use tools like cURL or a web browser to access the endpoint. For example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3500
```

#### Configuration
The Express server supports the following configuration options:

* `NODE_ENV`: Sets the environment for the server. If set to "test", the server will use port 4000 instead of the default port 3500.
You can modify the configuration by setting the appropriate environment variables before starting the server.

#### API Endpoints
